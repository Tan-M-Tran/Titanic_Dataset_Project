Objective: Perform rudimentary data cleaning and train a logistic regression model using SciKitLearn library to predict Titanic survivors.

Summary: This dataset is a famous dataset from Kaggle. It features passengers aboard the Titanic which information about age, gender and passenger class to name a few along with whether or not that passenger survived. Initial data cleaning involved looking for null values and replacing them with zeroes where applicable. A logisitic model was then trained to try to predict Titanic survivors based on selected features. The logistic model parameters were then tuned using GridSearchCV in order to maximize our metrics.
