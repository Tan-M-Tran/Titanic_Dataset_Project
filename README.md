Objective: Perform rudimentary data cleaning and train a logistic regression model using SciKitLearn library to predict Titanic survivors.

Summary: This dataset is a famous dataset from Kaggle. It features passengers aboard the Titanic which information about age, gender and passenger class to name a few along with whether or not that passenger survived. Initial data cleaning involved looking for null values and replacing them with zeroes where applicable. A logisitic model was then trained to try to predict Titanic survivors based on selected features. The logistic model parameters were then tuned using GridSearchCV in order to maximize our metrics.

## Data Visualization
I created a data visualization of this dataset using the dimple.js library. The bar plot is meant to convey that women were more likely to survive than men and higher class passengers were also more likely to survive.
